title: "Session 3: AI for Transport Data Analysis"
---

## Introduction

In this session, we will explore how AI can be used to augment and accelerate data analysis tasks in transport planning. We will focus on using AI to write code for analyzing and visualizing transport data.

## 1. Finding and Cleaning Data with AI

*Placeholder: Describe how to use AI tools (like ChatGPT or Copilot) to identify relevant datasets and write scripts to clean and format them.*

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with AI

*Placeholder: Explain how to use AI to generate summary statistics, identify trends, and perform initial data quality checks.*

## 3. AI-Assisted Data Visualization

*Placeholder: Demonstrate how to use AI to generate code for creating charts and maps, including interactive visualizations.*

## 4. Interpreting Results with LLMs

*Placeholder: Discuss how to use Large Language Models to help interpret data analysis results and generate narrative summaries.*

## 5. Practical Exercise

*Placeholder: Outline a hands-on exercise where participants will use AI tools to analyze a sample transport dataset.*
