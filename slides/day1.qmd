-   Real-world transport applications
-   Ethical considerations

See: [Session 1 materials](../s1.qmd)

## Different ways to use AI

Example output from Microsoft 365 Copilot

## Microsoft 365 Copilot vs. GitHub Copilot

*Microsoft 365* Copilot has limited coding capabilities compared to *GitHub Copilot* in VS Code.
M365 Copilot is primarily designed for productivity tasks (emails, documents, data analysis), not software development.
