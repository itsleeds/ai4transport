title: "Session 1: Foundations of AI and Data Science for Transport in Transport"
---

## Introduction

This session provides a foundation for understanding and applying AI in transport planning.
We will demystify AI, introduce Data Science as a framework for its effective application, and explore real-world use cases.

## Quick Start: Try it Now

Before we dive into the theory, let's see AI in action.
You don't need to install anything yet.

1.  Open a new tab and go to a free AI chat tool like [Microsoft 365 Copilot](https://m365.cloud.microsoft/chat/?auth=2&home=1&from=ShellLogo) (available to staff in many organisations with IT services provided by Microsoft at [m365.cloud.microsoft/](https://m365.cloud.microsoft/chat/?auth=2&home=1&from=ShellLogo)), [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com), [Claude](https://claude.ai), or [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com).
2.  Copy and paste the following prompt:

> "I am a transport planner for a medium-sized UK town. We are proposing a new segregated cycle lane on a busy high street, but local business owners are worried about the loss of parking. Draft a short response explaining the long-term economic benefits of increased footfall from cyclists and pedestrians. Keep it under 200 words."

3.  See what it produces, on your computer or by clicking the button to expand in the image below. Is it perfect? Probably not. Is it a good starting point? Often, yes.

This is the core of using AI: **it's not a replacement for your expertise, but an accelerator for your work.**

## Lecture

-   **Demystifying AI:**
    -   **What is a Large Language Model (LLM)?** Think of it as a super-advanced predictive text engine. It has "read" almost everything on the internet and learned patterns of language. When you ask it a question, it predicts the most likely next words to answer you based on those patterns. It doesn't "know" facts like a human, but it can simulate reasoning very well.
    -   Key concepts and terminology, with reference to [Anthropic's AI Fluency course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpGtOfSgR-c).
-   **Data Science Framework:** How to apply AI effectively within a robust data science workflow.
-   **AI in Transport:** Overview of applications in transport planning.
-   **Ethical Considerations:** "Garbage in, garbage out" vs. prompt and context engineering.

## Practical

This is an interactive session to explore real-world AI use cases in transport.

1.  **Identify AI Opportunities (20 mins):**
    -   On paper, draw a flowchart of a typical task from your work.
    -   Draw a second flowchart showing how AI could be integrated to improve this workflow.
    -   *Bonus:* If you have time, repeat for another task. Which is more suitable for AI integration?
2.  **Group Discussion (20 mins):**
    -   In small groups, discuss how AI could be best integrated into your work from first principles.
3.  **Group Feedback (20 mins):**
    -   Share key themes and ideas from your group discussion with everyone.
