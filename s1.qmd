title: "Session 1: Foundations of AI in Transport"
---

## Introduction

This session provides a foundation for understanding and applying AI in transport planning. We will demystify AI, introduce Data Science as a framework for its effective application, and explore real-world use cases.

## Lecture

-   **Demystifying AI:** Key concepts and terminology, with reference to [Anthropic's AI Fluency course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpGtOfSgR-c).
-   **Data Science Framework:** How to apply AI effectively within a robust data science workflow.
-   **AI in Transport:** Overview of applications in transport planning.
-   **Ethical Considerations:** "Garbage in, garbage out" vs. prompt and context engineering.

## Practical

This is an interactive session to explore real-world AI use cases in transport.

1.  **Identify AI Opportunities (20 mins):**
    -   On paper, draw a flowchart of a typical task from your work.
    -   Draw a second flowchart showing how AI could be integrated to improve this workflow.
    -   *Bonus:* If you have time, repeat for another task. Which is more suitable for AI integration?

2.  **Group Discussion (20 mins):**
    -   In small groups, discuss how AI could be best integrated into your work from first principles.

3.  **Group Feedback (20 mins):**
    -   Share key themes and ideas from your group discussion with everyone.
