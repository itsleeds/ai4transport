This repo contains code to support teaching the use of data science and AI and Data Science for Transport planning.
By AI we mean services such as Google Gemini, ChatGPT and similar tools from web user interfaces and APIs to:

-   Automate boring tasks
-   Speed-up work to increase productivity
-   Enhance capabilities, leading to new and better outputs

The ultimate goal is more effective transport planning investments and decisions

### Python Environment Setup

Some Quarto documents in this repository utilize Python code. To ensure these documents render correctly, it's recommended to set up a Python virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies.

1.  **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    ```
2.  **Activate the virtual environment (Linux/macOS):**
    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
    (On Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\activate`)
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib numpy osmnx geopandas shapely openai requests pypdf ipython jupyter openpyxl tabulate jupyter-cache
    ```

The trigger for the course was interest from Transport for the South East (TfSE) in using AI to improve transport planning.
See the [tfse](tfse) document for the (currently in-development) course content for that specific course.
