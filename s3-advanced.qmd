## Introduction

Building on Session 2’s AI-powered coding, this session shows how to call an LLM API from code to automate repeatable analysis tasks. You’ll set up a client securely, make simple requests, request structured (JSON) outputs, and analyse a PDF fetched from the web. This sets you up for Session 4, where we apply AI to transport data analysis.

## What you’ll learn

- Set up an API client
- Send a basic prompt and parse a response
- Ask the model for structured JSON and validate it
- Fetch a PDF from a URL, extract text, and summarise it reproducibly
- Batch a task across multiple files

## Level 0: The Non-Coder Approach (Chat with your PDF)

Before we write code, it is important to know that you can do single-document analysis without any programming.

**Try this manual workflow:**
1.  Go to [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai), [ChatGPT Plus](https://chatgpt.com), or [Gemini Advanced](https://gemini.google.com).
2.  Click the "paperclip" or "plus" icon to upload a PDF (e.g., a local transport policy document).
3.  Ask: *"Summarise the key transport objectives in this document as a bulleted list."*

**Why do we need code then?**
Imagine you have **500 planning applications** to review. Uploading them one by one and copying the answers into Excel would take days.
The method below allows you to write a script once and process 5, 500, or 5,000 documents automatically while you grab a coffee.

## Level 1: Automating for Scale (Python Setup)

We’ll use Python to build this automation. If packages are missing, install them first.

```{python}
#!pip install openai requests pypdf
import os
import json
from typing import List, Dict
from openai import OpenAI
```

Best practice is to set your API key as an environment variable (don’t hard-code secrets). You can do this using PowerShell or through the `.env` file directly.


Now create the client:

```{python}
ROUTER_API_KEY = 'link to your api key location'

CLIENT = OpenAI(
    api_key=ROUTER_API_KEY,
    default_headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {ROUTER_API_KEY}"}
)


```

## A simple chat completion

This mirrors what you do in a chat UI, but from code:

```{python}
resp = CLIENT.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-5-mini",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a dilligent, concise transport planning assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a family-friendly transport planning joke."}
    ]
)
print(resp.choices[0].message.content)
```

Try tweaking the prompt style (e.g., more witty, drier, aimed at students vs. professionals).

## Getting structured (JSON) outputs

When you need to use the response downstream, ask the model to return JSON and validate it.

```{python}
schema_hint = {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "title": {"type": "string"},
        "insight": {"type": "string"},
        "confidence": {"type": "number"}
    },
    "required": ["title", "insight", "confidence"]
}

prompt = (
    "Summarise one noteworthy transport planning insight from London’s congestion pricing "
    "policy in 1-2 sentences. Return only valid JSON with keys: title, insight, confidence (0-1)."
)

resp = CLIENT.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-5-mini",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "Return only JSON, no extra text."},
        {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
    ]
)

raw = resp.choices[0].message.content
try:
    data = json.loads(raw)
    assert set(["title", "insight", "confidence"]) <= set(data.keys())
except Exception as e:
    raise ValueError(f"Model did not return valid JSON. Raw output: {raw}") from e

data
```

## Analysing a PDF from a URL (robust approach)

Rather than relying on vendor-specific file-upload APIs, we’ll fetch the PDF, extract text locally, then send concise excerpts to the model. This is portable and keeps you in control of pre-processing.

```{python}
!pip install pypdf
import io
import math
import requests
from pypdf import PdfReader

def fetch_pdf_text(url: str, max_pages: int = 5) -> str:
    """Download a PDF and extract text from the first `max_pages` pages."""
    r = requests.get(url, timeout=30)
    r.raise_for_status()
    with io.BytesIO(r.content) as f:
        reader = PdfReader(f)
        pages = min(max_pages, len(reader.pages))
        text = []
        for i in range(pages):
            text.append(reader.pages[i].extract_text() or "")
    return "\n\n".join(text).strip()

def chunk_text(text: str, chunk_chars: int = 6000) -> List[str]:
    """Split text into roughly token-sized chunks for prompting."""
    chunks = []
    for i in range(0, len(text), chunk_chars):
        chunks.append(text[i:i+chunk_chars])
    return chunks

def summarise_pdf(url: str, task: str = "Summarise and comment on this document for a transport audience.") -> str:
    text = fetch_pdf_text(url)
    if not text:
        return "No text extracted from the PDF."
    chunks = chunk_text(text)
    summaries = []
    for idx, ch in enumerate(chunks, start=1):
        r = CLIENT.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-5-mini",
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content": "You are a precise analyst. Keep outputs concise."},
                {"role": "user", "content": f"{task}\n\nChunk {idx}/{len(chunks)}:\n{ch}"}
            ]
        )
        summaries.append(r.choices[0].message.content)
    # Compress partial summaries into a final synthesis
    final = CLIENT.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-5-mini",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "Create a single, coherent summary with key takeaways."},
            {"role": "user", "content": "\n\n".join(summaries)}
        ]
    )
    return final.choices[0].message.content

# Example (uses a classic sample PDF)
sample_url = "https://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tests/xhtml/testfiles/resources/pdf/dummy.pdf"
summarise_pdf(sample_url)
```

### Try it

- Change `max_pages` in `fetch_pdf_text` to control cost/speed.
- Swap `task` to focus on risks, methods, or key findings.
- Use your own PDF URLs (public reports, guidance docs, etc.).

## Batch a task across multiple documents

You’ll often need a small, consistent record per file (e.g., title, 2–3 bullet insights, and a confidence score). Here’s a simple batcher that writes JSON Lines (one JSON object per line):

```{python}
from datetime import datetime

def extract_insights(text: str) -> Dict:
    prompt = (
        "From the provided text, output JSON with: title, bullets (array of 2-3 concise points),"
        " confidence (0-1). Return only JSON."
    )
    r = CLIENT.chat.completions.create(
        model=MODEL,
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "Return valid JSON only."},
            {"role": "user", "content": f"{prompt}\n\n{text[:6000]}"}
        ]
    )
    raw = r.choices[0].message.content
    try:
        return json.loads(raw)
    except Exception:
        return {"title": "(parse_error)", "bullets": [raw], "confidence": 0.0}

def batch_process(urls: List[str], out_path: str = "insights.jsonl") -> str:
    with open(out_path, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        for url in urls:
            try:
                text = fetch_pdf_text(url, max_pages=5)
                data = extract_insights(text)
                data.update({"source": url, "ts": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()})
                f.write(json.dumps(data, ensure_ascii=False) + "\n")
            except Exception as e:
                f.write(json.dumps({
                    "source": url, "error": str(e), "ts": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
                }) + "\n")
    return out_path

urls = [
    "https://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tests/xhtml/testfiles/resources/pdf/dummy.pdf",
    # add more public PDF URLs here
]

batch_process(urls)
```

## Good practice and guardrails

- Reproducibility: fix the model name per project and log prompts.
- Privacy: don’t send sensitive data to third-party APIs without approval.
- Cost control: cap pages, chunk sizes, and batch sizes; cache intermediate results.
- Error handling: catch network errors/timeouts; write partial results with error notes.
- Version control: commit your scripts/notebooks; review diffs of prompt changes (links to Session 2).

## Where this fits in the course

- From Session 1: we’re applying AI within a clear workflow with ethical awareness.
- From Session 2: we’re turning assisted coding into reproducible automation.
- Into Session 4: we’ll apply the same ideas to transport data analysis and reporting.
