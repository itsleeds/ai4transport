This repo contains code to support teaching the use of data science and
AI for transport planning. By AI we mean services such as Google Gemini,
ChatGPT and similar tools from web user interfaces and APIs to:

- Automate boring tasks
- Speed-up work to increase productivity
- Enhance capabilities, leading to new and better outputs

The ultimate goal is more effective transport planning investments and decisions



## Who is this course for?



This course is designed specifically for:

-   **Transport Planners and Strategists** in local authorities and consultancies.

-   **Data Analysts** looking to modernize their workflows.

-   **Policy Officers** interested in evidence-based decision making.



**Do I need to be a coder?**

No! While we will use code (Python and R) to demonstrate the power of automation, the focus is on **concepts, workflows, and tools**. We provide the code for you to run and experiment with. A willingness to try new digital tools is the only requirement.



The trigger for the course was interest from Transport for the South

East (TfSE) in using AI to improve transport planning. See the

[tfse](tfse) document for the (currently in-development) course content

for that specific course.
