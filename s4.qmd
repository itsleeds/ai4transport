title: "Session 4: AI for Transport Data Analysis"
---

## Introduction

In this session, we'll explore how AI can accelerate the analysis of transport data. We will focus on a case study using spatio-temporal origin-destination (OD) data.

## Lecture: AI in Data Analysis

-   **Accelerating the Workflow:** How AI helps with data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
-   **Pattern Identification:** Using AI to uncover patterns and generate hypotheses from complex transport datasets.

## Practical: Analyzing Spatio-Temporal OD Data with AI

We will work through a guided case study using open access Call Detail Records (CDR) data from Spain.

### 1. Data Acquisition and Preparation with AI Assistance

-   We will use the `spanishoddata` package to download OD data.
-   Use an AI assistant to help write the R code to filter the data for a specific city (e.g., Seville).
-   Prepare the location and flow data for visualization.

### 2. AI-Powered Visualization

-   Use the `flowmapblue` package to create an interactive flow map.
-   Ask an AI assistant to help customize the map, for example, by adding animation or clustering.

### 3. Interpretation and Reporting

-   Use an LLM to help interpret the patterns shown in the flow map.
-   Generate a summary of the findings for a report.

## Course Wrap-up

-   Recap of the key concepts and skills covered in the course.
-   Q&A session.
