title: "Session 4: Applied AI"
---

## Introduction

In this final session, the focus shifts to you. This is a hands-on session designed for you to apply the AI tools and techniques learned throughout the day to your own transport problems and datasets.

## Objectives

-   **Apply AI Skills:** Use AI coding assistants, data analysis tools, and LLMs to solve real-world challenges relevant to your work.
-   **Problem Solving:** Tackle a specific problem or question you brought with you, or explore a provided dataset in depth.
-   **Peer Learning:** Share approaches and insights with colleagues, fostering a collaborative learning environment.

## Session Structure

### Problem Definition (15 mins)

-   Briefly define the problem you want to solve or the question you want to answer.
-   Identify the data you have available or need to acquire.
-   Determine which AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot) are most suitable for your task.

### Hands-on Development (60 mins)

-   **Work on your project:** Spend this time coding, analyzing data, or writing reports with the assistance of AI.
-   **Instructor Support:** The instructors will be circulating to provide one-on-one guidance and troubleshoot issues.
-   **Collaboration:** Feel free to work in pairs or small groups if you have similar interests or datasets.

### Show and Tell (15 mins)

-   Volunteers will have the opportunity to briefly share what they have achieved or discovered.
-   Discuss challenges faced and how AI helped (or didn't help) overcome them.

## Data for the Session

If you haven't brought your own data, you can use the datasets prepared for this course.
They are available on the [Releases page](https://github.com/itsleeds/ai4transport/releases) of the repository.
The files have been downloaded into the working directory.

### R

```{r}
#| label: load-data-r
#| eval: false
library(sf)

# TfSE Boundary and Geographies
tfse_boundary = read_sf("tfse_boundary.geojson")
tfse_lads = read_sf("tfse_lads.gpkg")
tfse_msoas = read_sf("tfse_msoas.gpkg")

# Motorway Network
motorways = read_sf("south_east_motorways.gpkg")

# Collision Data
collisions = read_sf("collisions_tfse_2020_2024.gpkg")

# OD Data
od = read.csv("od_tfse_2021.csv")
```

### Python

```{python}
#| label: load-data-python
#| eval: false
import geopandas as gpd

# TfSE Boundary and Geographies
tfse_boundary = gpd.read_file("tfse_boundary.geojson")
tfse_lads = gpd.read_file("tfse_lads.gpkg")
tfse_msoas = gpd.read_file("tfse_msoas.gpkg")

# Motorway Network
motorways = gpd.read_file("south_east_motorways.gpkg")

# Collision Data
collisions = gpd.read_file("collisions_tfse_2020_2024.gpkg")

# OD Data
import pandas as pd
od = pd.read_csv("od_tfse_2021.csv")
```

## Suggested Activities

If you didn't bring your own data, here are some challenges you can try using the open datasets we've looked at today:

-   **Advanced Visualization:** Create a dashboard summarizing the OD data we used in Session 2.
-   **Policy Analysis:** Use an LLM to compare two different transport policy documents and identify conflicting recommendations.
-   **Automated Reporting:** Write a script that automatically generates a summary report from a CSV file of traffic counts.

## Course Wrap-up

-   Final Q&A.
-   Resources for further learning.
-   Feedback and next steps.
