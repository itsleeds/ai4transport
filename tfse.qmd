<!-- tfse ask

It was a pleasure meeting you both earlier today, and apologies again for the rushed ending. As promised, I’ve summarised our discussion and next steps below.
 
Current Position and Phase 1:
Phase 1 of support is being delivered through TfSE’s subject matter expert supply chain. While these commissions are not yet fully confirmed, our preference is to continue with this approach for Phase 1 and build any follow-on support (Phase 2) around it.
Phase 1 will cover three key areas:
Introduction to AI and its application in transport planning (high level)
AI in data analysis
Practical applications in transport planning
 
To shape the next stage of support with your team, we agreed that the best approach is to:
Share a hypothesis for what the course could look like, including day-to-day challenges and relevant user cases. This could also include some questions to go into the Chat Forum, or survey style format to users to understand in a bit more detail what it is they require, or if the hypothesis suits their needs.
Focus on fundamentals, given current capability levels, but also incorporate case studies and examples (as you mentioned) to highlight real opportunities.
Keep the theme of “demystifying AI”, while allowing for adjustments after our introductory session, so we can avoid duplication. -->

## Course Overview

This 6-hour course provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of Data Science and AI and Data Science for Transport.

We have found consistently that the best way to take advantage of the new AI tools and techniques is to integrate them into robust and reproducible data science methods.
The principles of "garbage in, garbage out" and "all models are wrong but some are useful" applies equally to AI models as they do to traditional models.
With the power of AI, it is even more important to have have high-quality input datasets, reproducible workflows that enable quality assurance (QA) steps and agile development practices that can adapt to changing datasets, requirements and computational capabilities.

This course will focus on practical applications and real-world examples to help participants understand how to leverage AI in their work.

Participants will consolidate their knowledge of fundamental concepts, tools, and techniques and learn to apply them to analyze transport datasets, gain insights, and add value.
By the end of it, you will be empowered to use AI and other digital tools to convert raw datasets into actionable evidence for safer, healthier and more efficient transportation systems.
The course will be tailored to the specific needs and backgrounds of Transport for the South East.
