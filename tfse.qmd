<!-- tfse ask

It was a pleasure meeting you both earlier today, and apologies again for the rushed ending. As promised, I’ve summarised our discussion and next steps below.
 
Current Position and Phase 1:
Phase 1 of support is being delivered through TfSE’s subject matter expert supply chain. While these commissions are not yet fully confirmed, our preference is to continue with this approach for Phase 1 and build any follow-on support (Phase 2) around it.
Phase 1 will cover three key areas:
Introduction to AI and its application in transport planning (high level)
AI in data analysis
Practical applications in transport planning
 
To shape the next stage of support with your team, we agreed that the best approach is to:
Share a hypothesis for what the course could look like, including day-to-day challenges and relevant user cases. This could also include some questions to go into the Chat Forum, or survey style format to users to understand in a bit more detail what it is they require, or if the hypothesis suits their needs.
Focus on fundamentals, given current capability levels, but also incorporate case studies and examples (as you mentioned) to highlight real opportunities.
Keep the theme of “demystifying AI”, while allowing for adjustments after our introductory session, so we can avoid duplication. -->

# Introduction

We're developing materials to support teaching of AI for transport, building on introductory webinars on AI and transport that will cover:

- Webinar 1: What is AI?
- Use of AI in data analysis
- Application of AI in transport planning

# Questions for course organisers

- What compute environments do participants have access to currently?
  - VS Code + copilot
  - Jupyter Notebooks
  - Cloud provider such as AWS or Google Cloud

- Any additional information on what software they use on a daily basis

# Questions for potential attendees

We would like to collect responses to the following questions from potential attendees:

## Current working practices

- Which software, web applications or other digital tools do you use for your day-to-day transport planning work?
- With reference to a recent project or concrete example, describe typical work tasks that you need to complete on a day-to-day basis.
- What are the most boring parts of your work?
- Which parts of your work are most conducive to automation?

## AI tools

- Which AI tools have you heard of?
- Which AI tools have you tested?
- Which AI tools do you currently use in your work (if any)?
- Are there any particular AI tools or technologies you are interested in learning more about?

## Data and data science

- How do you currently use data in your decision-making processes?
- What kinds of data do you use?
- Which data science tools do you use?
- Do you use any programming languages (e.g., Python, R) for data analysis?
- Do you use interactive development environments (e.g. VS Code) for your work, and if so which?

## General

- What skills or knowledge do you hope to gain from this course?

<!-- ## Course Overview

This 8-hour online course provides a comprehensive introduction to the exciting field of Transport Data Science. Students will learn the fundamental concepts, tools, and techniques to analyze transport datasets, gain insights, and add value. By the end of it, you will be empowered to use free and open source data and digital tools to convert open access datasets into actionable evidence for safer, healthier and more efficient transportation systems. The course is designed for people who have experience with data science and would like to apply their skills in the transport sector and for transport professionals and researchers to empower their work with data science.
